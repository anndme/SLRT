# SLRT
Efficient Non-Interactive and Privacy-Preserving Logistic Regression Model
This is the implementation of a non interactive privacy preserving logical regression training algorithm (SLRT) based on secret sharing. 
At the same time, it provides the code of HE based non interactive scheme (VANE), the code of training LR model in plaintext, 
and the data set used for training.
